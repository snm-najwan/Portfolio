### Projects (Analysis)
1 . [Body Fat Prediction Using Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Uni-Projects/blob/main/Body%20Fat%20Prediction%20using%20ML%20models.pdf)

This is my University final year project. I have used three Machine Learning models to compare which model predict the better for Body Fat which is calculated from Antroprometric measures that involves no digital measures and use easier and non expensive methods to take measurements. For this project I used **Neural Network**, **Multiple Linear Regression**, and **Partial least Squares Regression** and used **R Statistical Software** for this project. As a result of the analysis I got Neural Network as the best model between all three models with 94% accuracy.

2 . [Statistical Analysis in the context of Business Growth](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Uni-Projects/blob/main/Statistical%20Analysis%20in%20the%20context%20of%20Business%20Growth.pdf)

In this project we did analyze the data of an online retail company which operates from United Kingdom. During the past years the company has experienced a gradual increase in the attrition of existing customers which has affected the organizational performance. To identify what factors to focus in retaining the customers by understanding the gaps from organization point of view. For this particular analysis we used **Data mining** to identify the patterns and relationship between the products also Association rule mining was done under the apriori principle with support of 2% and confidence of 70% to find out the products which are bought together by customers most frequently and to group the products which are sharing similarity in selling based on region, country like wise we have used **cluster analysis** especially K - means clustering. We also approched this dataset with **Time Series Analysis** to find the trends and periods.
