### Projects

1 . [Body Fat Prediction Using Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Uni-Projects/blob/main/Body%20Fat%20Prediction%20using%20ML%20models.pdf)

This is my University final year project. I have used three Machine Learning models to compare which model predict the better for Body Fat which is calculated from Antroprometric measures that involves no digital measures and use easier and non expensive methods to take measurements. For this project I used **Neural Network**, **Multiple Linear Regression**, and **Partial least Squares Regression** and used **R Statistical Software** for this project. As a result of the analysis I got Neural Network as the best model between all three models with 94% accuracy.

2 . [Statistical Analysis in the context of Business Growth](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Uni-Projects/blob/main/Statistical%20Analysis%20in%20the%20context%20of%20Business%20Growth.pdf)

In this project we did analyze the data of an online retail company which operates from United Kingdom. During the past years the company has experienced a gradual increase in the attrition of existing customers which has affected the organizational performance. To identify what factors to focus in retaining the customers by understanding the gaps from organization point of view. For this particular analysis we used **Data mining** to identify the patterns and relationship between the products also Association rule mining was done under the apriori principle with support of 2% and confidence of 70% to find out the products which are bought together by customers most frequently and to group the products which are sharing similarity in selling based on region, country like wise we have used **cluster analysis** especially K - means clustering. We also approched this dataset with **Time Series Analysis** to find the trends and periods.

3 . [VBA User Interface App for Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Projects/blob/main/User%20Interface%20App.xlsm)

<img src="UserInterface.png">

This is my Excel VBA project. In which I used VBA Userform to create User Interface to perform moving averages (3 ,6 12 point moving averages), Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Trend and Winter's Seasonal method on timely data to predict and visualize trends and seasonality.

4 . [Machine Learning project Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Visualizations/blob/main/housingPricesPrediction.ipynb)

This is a machine learning project where i try to improve the model performance by applying feature scaling (Polynomial Features, Removing Outliers) for housing prices prediction dataset. And able to bring the model performance upto 75.2.

5 . [R Shiny web app for Data Visualization](web_visualization.R)

I have created a R Shiny Web Visualization for supermarket dataset. It provides interfaces to change the categorical and numerical variable as per the graph type. The relevant dataset for this application to work can be able get from [here]()

### Projects (Visualizations)

1 . [Billionaires Analysis](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Visualizations/blob/main/Billionairs.ipynb)

I have used a dataset from Kaggle website to portray top richest people in the world. In this analysis I have used Python Matplotlib package to visualize the data and to get the clear idea which sectors, gender, country, and industry are driven the top richest people in the world.

2 . [European Sales Record](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/seyyad.najwan/viz/FirstTableauViz_17094577677880/Dashboard1#1)

Here I have published my Tableau visualization which shows the analysis of european sales record. In which to analyze and visualize the products sold and consumed from 2010 to 2017 in european countries.

3 . [Credit Card Transactions in India](https://github.com/snm-najwan/Visualizations/blob/main/Credit%20card%20Transactions%20(India).pbix)

<img src="dashboard.png">

I created an interactive Power BI dashboard from Credit card Transaction details dataset which primarily showing transactions happened in India.
